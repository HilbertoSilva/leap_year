# leap_year
Small function to determine if a given year is a leap year or not. 

A leap year happens when the year is divisible by 4, unless it's also divisible by 100 (in which case it's not a leap year), unless it's also divisible by 400 (in this case it is a leap year).
Confusing?

Glad there is a program for that!
